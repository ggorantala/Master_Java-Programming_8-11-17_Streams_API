# Java-Functional-Programming-With-Lambdas-and-Streams-API
Functional programming got introduced in Java SE 8 and has recently gained popularity.

The number of lines written by developers in the last few years using functional programming(for open-source projects)
did hustle around Java developers. This repository contains code snippets and examples
of the course created on [https://ggorantala.dev](https://ggorantala.dev)

This is one of the most important/critical topics when someone starts preparing for coding interviews for FAANG/startup companies.

To kick things off, youâ€™ll start by learning about functional programming and functional interfaces.
Then youâ€™ll learn about the core features such as lambda expressions, method references, and streams API.

Throughout, you will get tons of hands-on experience working through practice problems to help sharpen your understanding. By completing this course, you can apply functional programming at work and in interviews.

By completing this course, you will be able to refactor existing codebase or write up OOP design faster with greater efficiency.

## What is Functional Programming?
Functional programming got introduced in Java SE 8 and has recently gained popularity, and the number of lines written by developers in the last few years using functional programming(for open-source projects) did hustle around Java developers.

1. No wonder developers fell in love with functional programming with fewer lines of code.
2. The Java community encourages more and more developers to embrace this programming style.
3. In this course, you will learn how to write functional programming code with lambda expressions and Streams API, etc. 4. Having a detailed knowledge of this topic will help you write clean and single-line Java code snippets for most business use cases.
4. Functional programming provides high performance in processing extensive data for applications.

This course benefits all Java developers who want to get strong with modern Java SE 8/11/17 LTS version features. Wait, thereâ€™s much more we will discuss in this course.

## List of topics covered:

1. Functional Programming
2. Functional Interfaces
3. Imperative and declarative programming paradigms
4. Lambda Expressions
5. Method References
6. Streams API
    1. Stream Filters
    2. Stream Transformations
    3. Stream aggregate functions
    4. Stream Duplicates
    5. Stream parallel processing.
7. Final thoughts and conclusion

## Prerequisites
To take full advantage of this course, one should ideally have the following:

1. Knowledge of Java basics.
2. Create and run a simple Java program.
3. Collections API (optional)

Install Java 8 or above versions if you wish to run the example code snippets locally in your IDE(Integrated Development Environment).

## The most rewarding outcome of this course
The most rewarding outcome of this course is that you will learn

1. What are the most common ways to solve problems using Java functions and streams API with real-world business use-case examples?
2. Hands-on practical examples

ðŸ¤© Happy coding!!
